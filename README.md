This is a test of editing a simple [Twine](http://twinery.org/2) project via Glitch. It looks like it works well because I was able to add new links & passages.

# HOW TO USE GLITCH TO EDIT TWINE

_Create new passages like this:_<br>
**\<tw-passagedata name=\"My New Passage\"\>** Passage text **\</tw-passagedata\>**

_Add links:_<br>
Add links \[\[like this\]\] just like a normal Twine game

_Note:_<br>
Your starting passage must have pid=\"1\" or else Twine doesn't know where to start the story
